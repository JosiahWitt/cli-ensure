# Ensure CLI

## :warning: CLI Has Moved! :warning:

The ensure CLI has moved to the [`ensure` repo](https://github.com/JosiahWitt/ensure) as part of a large refactoring effort on the `ensure mocks generate` command.
You can learn more about the refactor on the [`v0.2.0` release page](https://github.com/JosiahWitt/ensure/releases/tag/cmd%2Fensure%2Fv0.2.0).

Please install the new CLI using:
```bash
# Requires Go 1.16+
$ go install github.com/JosiahWitt/ensure/cmd/ensure@latest
```


## :warning: Repo Deprecation :warning:
This separate `ensure-cli` repo is **deprecated**, and unless any major issues are identified with the [refactored version](https://github.com/JosiahWitt/ensure/tree/master/cmd/ensure), this repo will be archived on or after **August 1, 2022**.
